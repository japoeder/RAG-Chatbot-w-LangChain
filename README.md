# RAG Chatbot with LangChain And Neo4j

### Project Introduction

Welcome to my GitHub repository where I am pioneering a state-of-the-art chatbot tailored specifically for a large hospital network. This project harnesses the power of large language models (LLMs) and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) technologies to craft a sophisticated communication tool that enhances data accessibility and management within healthcare settings.

My goal is to capitalize on the impressive capabilities demonstrated by LLMs, such as those seen in OpenAI's ChatGPT, to improve interactions within the hospital environment. By integrating the LangChain library, this chatbot can adeptly navigate and utilize data from Neo4j databases, providing crucial information on patients, medical staff, and hospital operations.

This chatbot is engineered to benefit various stakeholders within the hospital systemâ€”facilitating patients with inquiries about services and treatments, and aiding staff with streamlined administrative processes. Through a conversational interface, the chatbot delivers quick access to comprehensive contextual information, thereby enhancing operational efficiency and elevating patient care quality.





























This portfolio is a compilation of all the AI/ML data science projects I have done for academic and self-learning purposes. Note that it also contains achievements, skills, and certificates. Finally, please feel free to check back often as it is updated on the regular basis.

        <strong><a href="https://github.com/japoeder/Origination-Model-Project">Origination Model (Credit Risk)</a></strong>
        <p>This project applies various classification models such as Logistic Regression (pytorch & sklearn), Random Forest, and XGBoost to solve an important origination problem in the credit risk space. The models for the most part have comparable accuracy metrics aside from xgboost, which may perform better with some additional fine tuning.</p>

        <strong><a href="https://github.com/japoeder/Basket-Analysis">Basket Analysis (Retail Analytics)</a></strong>
        <p>This Instacart basket analysis is focused on understanding customer purchasing patterns using a dataset containing 3 million grocery orders from over 200,000 Instacart users. The files encompasse a variety of data on order details, product information, and the order in which products were added to the cart.</p>

        <strong><a href="https://github.com/japoeder/aws_cost_tracking">Slack alerting for AWS</a></strong>
        <p>It's really easy for AWS costs to slip under the radar and accrue to unexpected amounts. While Amazon does provide some functionality with their cost explorer meant to address that, it is not as flexible in how the data can be aggregated and it isn't integrated with Slack as far as I'm aware. This project addresses that.</p>
